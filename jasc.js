let age = 21 // let can only we used once to declare variable

let next = age + 1 // has let because we are defining a new variable next


console.log(age) //console.log() similar to print
console.log(next) //console.log() similar to print

3 + 4 // Adds 3 and 4: 7

let x = 2
let y = 3
x+y //Adds x and y, so in this example 2 + 3: 5

x*y // Multiplies x and y, so in this example: 2 * 3: 6
